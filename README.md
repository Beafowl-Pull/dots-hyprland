    <h3> All hyped up with Ags </h3>
</div>

- -- WORK IN PROGRESS --
- [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/) is pretty much GJS on layer shells, so anything should be possible. I plan to make stuff work properly on a range of devices, so it'll probably take quite some time.
- Planned stuff
  - Keyboard friendly widgets: accessible with or without a mouse
  - Flexible: Scalable. Light/Dark mode support. Adapts to your wallpaper.
